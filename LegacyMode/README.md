## What is Legacy Mode

Legacy mode is the mode meant to emulate the services of a proprietary SIM card from *origin_point* to 2021 (or later) it uses the classic SIM card formatting, and is meant to emulate a SIM card without a SIM card being in your phone. It also doesn't have to contact the carrier, it just emulates their service.
