## Extra:

### What happened to draft 1A?

It isn't being released to this repository, as it contains a rant that seemed a bit unprofessional and not in the scope of my main projects guidelines. It also had some copyright issues that were kind of stupid related to 20th century Fox. I have been low energy today, and I kept the old draft. I am still trying to figure out where and how I will release it. Draft 1B is much more refined.
