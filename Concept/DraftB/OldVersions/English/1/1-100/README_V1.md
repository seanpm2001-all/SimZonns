# SimZonns draft 1B

An open source SIM card implementation because SIM cards are too proprietary and difficult (I have been suffering with a failing S20 FE 5G and I am prompted to solve the problem with this project)

## Names and pronunciations

SimZon - Taken

SimZonns (pronunciation: Sim Zawns, or Simpsons (unoffficial))

### Legacy mode 

Legacy mode (for the current SIM card structures) {

### Emulation

Verizon (vz-vm)

Sprint (spr-vm)

T-mobile (tmo-vm)

### Network modes

GLOBAL

LTE/CDMA

LTE/GSM/UMTS

### Tethering

Tethering protection: disabled by default (as tethering is OK and shouldn't be mandatorially disallowed)

### ICCID

#### Issuer Identifier Number

standard: max=7 digits
  
Major industry identifier (MII), 2 fixed digits, 89 for telecommunication purposes.

Country code, 2 or 3 digits, as defined by ITU-T recommendation E.164.

NANP countries, apart from Canada, use 01, i.e. prepending a zero to their common calling code +1

Canada uses 302

Russia uses 701, i.e. appending 01 to its calling code +7

Kazakhstan uses 997, even though it shares the calling code +7 with Russia

Issuer identifier, 1â€“4 digits.

Often identical to the mobile network code (MNC).


### Encryption

Encryption: 128 bit    
      
}

## ZSIM

  // I have noted many flaws with the structure of SIM cards and I am going to attempt to try and improve them for a better open source standard and for future proofing.

## Extra:

### What happened to draft 1A?

It isn't being released to this repository, as it contains a rant that seemed a bit unprofessional and not in the scope of my main projects guidelines. It also had some copyright issues that were kind of stupid related to 20th century Fox. I have been low energy today, and I kept the old draft. I am still trying to figure out where and how I will release it. Draft 1B is much more refined.
